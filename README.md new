# King County House Sales Analysis
This project analyzes the King County House Sales dataset to gain insights into the housing market of King County, with the goal of helping real estate agencies and property management companies make more informed business decisions.

Business Understanding
Stakeholder
The stakeholder for this dataset is a real estate agency or a property management company that deals with buying, selling, and renting houses in King County.

Business Problem
The business problem that this stakeholder might face is determining the factors that influence house prices in the county. By understanding these factors, they could price their properties more accurately, invest in the right locations, and negotiate better deals with buyers and sellers.

Data Understanding
The King County House Sales dataset contains information on the sale of houses in King County between May 2014 and May 2015. It includes 21 columns with information such as the sale price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, and location.

Data Preparation
The dataset was cleaned by removing any missing or duplicate values, and feature engineering was performed to create new features such as the age of the house and the price per square foot.

Modeling
Regression modeling was used to predict house prices based on the features in the dataset. Several models were tested, including linear regression, polynomial regression, and random forest regression, and the best model was selected based on its performance on the test data.

Evaluation
The performance of the selected model was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared. The results showed that the model was able to accurately predict house prices with an R-squared value of 0.8.

Conclusion
The analysis of the King County House Sales dataset provided insights into the factors that influence house prices in the county, such as location, size, and condition of the house. These insights can be used by real estate agencies and property management companies to make more informed business decisions and provide better advice to homeowners on how to increase the value of their homes.

Future Work
In the future, additional features could be added to the dataset, such as the proximity to schools, parks, and other amenities. More advanced modeling techniques, such as neural networks, could also be explored to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
